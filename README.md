A quick and dirty SDL based Almost-Game-Engine, scriptable through Common Lisp.

The goal: distribute the executable, which should be as stable as possible and should have as much graphic-stuff as possible, and script as much as possible.

Uses ECL and SDL 1.2 (sorry for that).

## Status

doing nothing special...
